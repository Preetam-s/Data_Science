# Project Using Machine Learning and Natural Language Processing on Election data and Inaugural Presidential Speeches built in NLTK package.
## Includes the Dataset, Jupyter Notebook and Project Report.pdf
### The Machine Learning Project 
##### 1. EDA is performed on the dataset.
##### 2. The data is later split into training data and testing data in a 70:30 split.
##### 3. ML Models such as Logistic Regression, Naive Bayes, KNN, Linear Discriminant Analysis techniques.
##### 4. Model Tuning using gridSearch CV was performed.
##### 5. The KNN model gives 91% accuracy.

### The NLTK project
##### 1. The Inaugural speeches is loaded from the nltk library.
##### 2. Word Tokkenization, Stemming, Stop words removal is performed
##### 3. Word clouds are generated using words.
